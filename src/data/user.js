			" I’m Bolade Olufayo. My journey into tech didn’t start with a laptop, it started behind a salon chair. For years, I worked as a professional hairstylist, helping clients bring their ideas to life through creativity, precision, and a lot of problem-solving. Along the way, I learned how to really listen, translate visions into reality, and manage multiple projects under pressure, skills that turned out to be just as valuable in software development. When I transitioned into Software Engineering, I discovered that coding is more than just writing lines of code, it’s about solving problems and creating experiences that people actually enjoy using. Today, I’m a Frontend Developer passionate about building applications that are clean, user-friendly, and accessible. I enjoy bringing ideas to life with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, and I’m constantly learning new tools and technologies to sharpen my craft . Beyond the code, I’m passionate about encouraging more women to explore opportunities in tech. I believe that creativity, empathy, and collaboration are just as important as technical skills, and I bring all of that to every project I work on. I've worked on a variety of projects over the months and I'm proud of the progress I've made. Many of these projects are open-source and available for others to explore and contribute to. If you're interested in any of the projects I've worked on, please feel free to check out the code and suggest any improvements or enhancements you might have in mind. Collaborating with others is a great way to learn and grow, and I'm always open to new ideas and feedback.",
